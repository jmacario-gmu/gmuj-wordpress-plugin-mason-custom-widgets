Plugin which provides Mason-specific custom WordPress widgets.

== Description ==

This plugin includes the following custom widgets:

* Alert ribbon: a sitewide alert message, designed to be used in the alert ribbon widget area provided by the Mason Twenty Twenty custom theme.
* Call-to-action list: call-to-action buttons providing arbitrary links (title, link, image).
* Call-to-action menu: call-to-action buttons providing links using a WordPress menu.
* Hightlight item: a content block with space for text and an associated image which can be floated left or right.
* Highlight list: a grid display of arbitrary links (title, links, image, description).
* People list: a grid display of people using a 'person' custom post type provided by the Mason Twenty Twenty custom theme. Can be filtered by the person 'group' taxonomy.
* Recent posts: a grid display of recent posts. Can be filtered by category. Uses the posts featured image or provides a placeholder image if no featured image is specified.
* Regex content: similar to the native WordPress custom HTML widget, but you can control on which pages the widget appears by using a regex match.

All of these widgets (with the exception of the alert ribbon) provide a feature to limit the display to only URLs matching a provided regular expression.
